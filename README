# LC Gatsby Starter

The LC Gatsby Starter was setup using Gatsby's Yarn Workspace Guide

## Thoughts:

- We could utilize this monorepo to build out a gatsby component library (headless?) that can be utilized across multiple gatsby sites that makes it easy to build out common site structures. Examples of these components could be navigation, section layouts, footers, integrations, etc...
- Multiple Gatsby Themes can be used to set up various features and configs with the base theme being the default config that we like to get started with (such as tailwind, helmet, sass)
